# NanoGT Match Report: Wilson disease

**Disease:** Wilson disease (ORPHA:905)  
**Primary gene:** ATP7B  
**Gene CDS:** 4398 bp  
**Inheritance:** Autosomal recessive  
**Target tissues scored:** liver, CNS  

---

## Interpretation

- At least one high-confidence precedent was found, but this is still a precedent match rather than a clinical-trial recommendation.
- Main review flags: Dual critical target tissues; confirm whether one route can plausibly address both clinical endpoints; Cell-autonomous protein across multiple tissues; high transduction coverage may be required; Narrow therapeutic window; evaluate newborn screening, presymptomatic diagnosis, or very early dosing feasibility.

### Disease Mechanism Evidence

**Molecular mechanism:** loss of function  
**Mechanistic detail:** ATP7B copper-transporting ATPase deficiency causes hepatic and CNS copper accumulation  
**Gene-addition compatibility:** conditional  
**Preferred modality class:** liver gene addition  
**Evidence level/status:** direct / needs_user_fact_check  
**Evidence summary:** ATP7B LOF supports liver-directed gene addition; large CDS (~4.3 kb) fits within AAV capacity  
**Evidence source:** [OMIM ATP7B 277900](https://omim.org/entry/277900)  

### Study-Level Limitations

- Catalog-relative ranking: current catalog contains 21 precedent programs and 8 vectors, so absence of a strong match is not proof that no therapy is possible.
- Modality coverage is limited mainly to AAV and lentiviral precedents; dual-AAV, LNP/mRNA, genome editing, ASO, and transplant-enabling strategies are not fully represented.
- Endpoint readiness: liver/metabolic targets may have biochemical biomarkers, but biomarker correction must be linked to clinical benefit.
- Endpoint risk: CNS/neurodevelopmental outcomes may require natural-history data, age-stratified endpoints, and long follow-up because short-term clinical change can be hard to interpret.
- Endpoint risk: multi-system disease may need a hierarchy of primary and secondary endpoints; one tissue response may not equal whole-disease benefit.

### Rationale

- Gene CDS 1353bp / cargo 4700bp (29% utilized)
- Vector tropism plus precedent target match: liver
- Both intracellular proteins
- Inheritance match (Autosomal recessive <-> AR)
- Unknown pathway — neutral score
- Disease mechanism: loss of function — ATP7B copper-transporting ATPase deficiency causes hepatic and CNS copper accumulation
- Gene-addition modality compatibility: conditionally supports gene addition; review disease-specific constraints
- Mechanism evidence: ATP7B LOF supports liver-directed gene addition; large CDS (~4.3 kb) fits within AAV capacity
- Mechanism source: OMIM ATP7B 277900 (https://omim.org/entry/277900)
- Approval status: phase2
- Vector immunogenicity (AAV5): low (~9%) — most patients eligible; minimal screening burden
- Very narrow therapeutic window — congenital or rapidly fatal early onset; in utero or immediate neonatal GT required; substantially increases trial complexity
- Intracellular or membrane-bound protein — no cross-correction possible; each target cell must individually receive the vector; requires high transduction efficiency and therefore a higher or more targeted dose
- Immune privilege: high privilege — blood-brain barrier severely limits T-cell access; durable expression expected
- Promoter availability: ApoE/hAAT, TBG, transthyretin, albumin — extensively validated; used in Hemgenix, Roctavian, DTX301
- Route of administration: IV systemic — established, minimally invasive; used in all hepatic GT programs
- ORGANELLE TARGETING: COMPATIBLE — ATP7B standard subcellular localisation; nuclear AAV delivery directly produces functional protein at the correct cellular compartment with no additional organelle-import steps required.

### Manual Review Flags

- Dual critical target tissues; confirm whether one route can plausibly address both clinical endpoints
- Cell-autonomous protein across multiple tissues; high transduction coverage may be required
- Narrow therapeutic window; evaluate newborn screening, presymptomatic diagnosis, or very early dosing feasibility
- Mechanism evidence is conditionally compatible with gene addition; review the listed disease-specific constraints before treating vector precedent as transferable
- Gene annotation incomplete; packaging, protein class, and localization scores need manual confirmation
- AAV tropism is species- and route-dependent; confirm human target-cell biodistribution rather than relying on animal tropism alone
