# NanoGT Match Report: Tay-Sachs disease

**Disease:** Tay-Sachs disease (ORPHA:845)  
**Primary gene:** HEXA  
**Gene CDS:** 1590 bp  
**Inheritance:** Autosomal recessive  
**Target tissues scored:** CNS  

---

## Interpretation

- At least one high-confidence precedent was found, but this is still a precedent match rather than a clinical-trial recommendation.
- Main review flags: Mechanism evidence is conditionally compatible with gene addition; review the listed disease-specific constraints before treating vector precedent as transferable; Gene annotation incomplete; packaging, protein class, and localization scores need manual confirmation; AAV tropism is species- and route-dependent; confirm human target-cell biodistribution rather than relying on animal tropism alone.

### Disease Mechanism Evidence

**Molecular mechanism:** loss of function  
**Mechanistic detail:** Beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit deficiency causes GM2 ganglioside accumulation in neurons  
**Gene-addition compatibility:** conditional  
**Preferred modality class:** cns gene addition or cross correction  
**Evidence level/status:** direct / needs_user_fact_check  
**Evidence summary:** HEXA LOF supports gene addition; CNS delivery and heterodimer assembly with HEXB subunit are key considerations  
**Evidence source:** [OMIM HEXA 272800](https://omim.org/entry/272800)  

### Study-Level Limitations

- Catalog-relative ranking: current catalog contains 21 precedent programs and 8 vectors, so absence of a strong match is not proof that no therapy is possible.
- Modality coverage is limited mainly to AAV and lentiviral precedents; dual-AAV, LNP/mRNA, genome editing, ASO, and transplant-enabling strategies are not fully represented.
- Endpoint risk: CNS/neurodevelopmental outcomes may require natural-history data, age-stratified endpoints, and long follow-up because short-term clinical change can be hard to interpret.

### Rationale

- Gene CDS 891bp / cargo 4700bp (19% utilized)
- Vector tropism plus precedent target match: cns
- Both intracellular proteins
- Inheritance match (Autosomal recessive <-> AR)
- Unknown pathway — neutral score
- Disease mechanism: loss of function — Beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit deficiency causes GM2 ganglioside accumulation in neurons
- Gene-addition modality compatibility: conditionally supports gene addition; review disease-specific constraints
- Mechanism evidence: HEXA LOF supports gene addition; CNS delivery and heterodimer assembly with HEXB subunit are key considerations
- Mechanism source: OMIM HEXA 272800 (https://omim.org/entry/272800)
- Approval status: approved
- Vector immunogenicity (AAV9): high (~22%) — substantial patient exclusion expected; immunodepletion protocols may be needed
- Moderate therapeutic window — progressive disease with childhood onset; early intervention strongly recommended; newborn screening integration beneficial
- Intracellular or membrane-bound protein — no cross-correction possible; each target cell must individually receive the vector; requires high transduction efficiency and therefore a higher or more targeted dose
- Immune privilege: high privilege — blood-brain barrier severely limits T-cell access; durable expression expected
- Promoter availability: Synapsin-1 (pan-neuronal), CaMKII (excitatory neurons), GFAP (astrocytes) — validated but cell-type specificity varies
- Route of administration: Intrathecal or ICV delivery — more invasive than IV; established in OAV101-IT and RGX-121 but higher procedural risk
- ORGANELLE TARGETING: COMPATIBLE — HEXA standard subcellular localisation; nuclear AAV delivery directly produces functional protein at the correct cellular compartment with no additional organelle-import steps required.

### Manual Review Flags

- Mechanism evidence is conditionally compatible with gene addition; review the listed disease-specific constraints before treating vector precedent as transferable
- Gene annotation incomplete; packaging, protein class, and localization scores need manual confirmation
